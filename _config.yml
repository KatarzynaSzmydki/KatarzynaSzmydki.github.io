  Hi, my name's Kasia. I'm a data analyst/BI developer with 5+ years experience. Using data to support business is what I'm passionate about.

  I'm most skilled in: 
  - Extracting and cleaning data (<mark>SQL</mark>, <mark>Python</mark>),
  - Visualisations, reporting (<mark>Power BI</mark>),
  - Consolidating and explaining complex issues to business in easly digestable form.
